            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>2024-04-19 --- 2024-04-20</p>
            <p>         I randomly decided to drive to Yangzhou on a weekend, going on Saturday and returning on Sunday. It's not too far. I took advantage of the spring to explore. The scenery at Slender West Lake is beautiful, but I couldn't quite accept Huaiyang cuisine. I went to a famous Huaiyang restaurant, but I thought it wasnâ€™t as good as the small noodle shop in Gaoyou, where you can get a bowl of green pepper pork noodles for 8 yuan, which is both cheap and delicious.</p>

            <h2>1. Hotel</h2>
            <p>04-19 <i class="fas fa-sun"></i></p>
            <p>         I booked the hotel through the app, and it showed that the hotel was called "Huxin Pavilion Hotel." But when I arrived, I found out it was actually called "Huxin Pavilion Guesthouse," and the room was very cramped. After that, my girlfriend never let me book hotels again.</p>

            <p>         Slender West Lake is quite beautiful, a typical Jiangnan-style landscape.</p>
