            <h2>1. Barbecue</h2>
            <p>04-26 <i class="fas fa-cloud"></i></p>
            <p>As someone from the Northeast, I usually don’t expect much from barbecue outside my hometown.  
But I have to say—Zibo barbecue was genuinely good.  
We randomly picked a roadside stall, sat on the curb eating and drinking, and it felt great.  
Halfway through, an elderly man walked over with a little dog and offered it some barbecue—only for the poor pup to immediately throw it all up.</p>
