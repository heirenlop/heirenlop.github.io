                Before the Lunar New Year, my mom came to Beijing and we drove back home together. During the holiday, my parents and I did a little tour of nearby cities—Qinhuangdao, Jinzhou, Chaoyang, and Panjin. A lot of them are basically just down the road, but as a “Liaoning native,” this was my first time actually exploring them properly. I used to think there wasn’t much to see around home—this trip completely changed that. Funny enough, the place I’m most familiar with is also the place I’ve explored the least.
