            Xining is known as the “Summer Capital,” and it really lives up to that name. It’s super cool in the summer. The day I left Xining for Hefei, it was only 20°C here, while Hefei was hitting nearly 40°C. That’s a crazy difference.
            The only downside? The sun. I remember the first time I came, my cousin and I played basketball all afternoon—and ended up as dark as coal."
