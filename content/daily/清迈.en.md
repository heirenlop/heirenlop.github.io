    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>2025-05-31 — 2025-06-05</p>
    <p>
        It was my first time visiting Thailand. I hesitated between Bangkok and Chiang Mai, but eventually went with Chiang Mai. I’d seen a lot of videos on YouTube and Bilibili about people living here short-term—it looked peaceful and slow-paced, which was exactly what I’d been craving. With some time off, I decided to come explore the city and experience what Thailand is really like. We started our trip in Hefei, drove to Nanjing Airport, then transferred through Shanghai before landing in Chiang Mai. When we touched down, the sky was overcast, the air was thick with heat and humidity, and I felt like I was wrapped in a steamy blanket the moment I stepped out of the plane.
    </p>
    <p>
        What impressed me the most over the next few days wasn’t the sights—but the people. Whether it was the hotel staff, street vendors, tuk-tuk drivers, delivery guys, massage therapists, or baristas, everyone spoke gently and patiently, never rushed or pushy. Even when language was a barrier, a smile and a few gestures were enough to communicate. The whole city feels like it’s wrapped in warm steam—calm, unhurried, and welcoming. It naturally slows you down.

    <h2>1. Hotel</h2>
    <p>This was my first time staying at a hotel with a pool. The environment was great, and the price was surprisingly affordable—only about 280 RMB per night on average through AGODA. The pool was right in the courtyard. It wasn't huge, but definitely enough for a relaxing dip. During the day, you’d often see foreigners lounging on chairs reading books, while Korean guests were more into splashing around in the water. At night, when fewer people were around, the whole place felt calm and peaceful.</p>

    <h2>2. City Streets</h2>
    <p>The streets in Chiang Mai are quite narrow and don’t really have dedicated bike lanes. Lining both sides of the roads are mostly massage parlors, coffee shops, and all kinds of eateries. Sometimes, you’ll even spot a temple tucked away in a side alley. A lot of the city still retains its old-school buildings, and the overhead power lines crisscrossing everywhere give the place a slightly chaotic look.</p>

    <h2>3. Transportation</h2>
    <p>Over the past few days, we mostly got around using tuk-tuks and Grab (Thailand’s version of Didi—it offers car rides, food delivery, and even motorbike taxis). Riding in a tuk-tuk or on a motorbike here is the best—cool wind rushing past your face, the sound of the city all around you. It’s refreshing and immersive. The traffic here is surprisingly well-behaved. I didn’t hear a single honk, and most drivers would stop for pedestrians at crosswalks.</p>
    <p>The first time I took a tuk-tuk, I got overcharged—he asked for 150 baht. I checked the price on Grab, and it would’ve been just 100. After that, I started bargaining. Same tactic as back home: name your price, the driver shakes his head, you pretend to walk away, and he chases after you saying, “OK, let’s go.”</p>

    <p>Riding a motorbike as a passenger is totally different from driving one yourself. I do have a motorcycle license, but this was my first time being on the back of someone else's bike. No helmet, no warning—just hop on and go. One hand lightly on the driver’s shoulder, the other gripping the seat handle for dear life. We probably hit 70 km/h on a straightaway. When I got off, my hands were sweaty from holding on so tightly. I had planned to take a photo mid-ride, but it was over before I could even pull out my phone. So I settled for a cool shot of the driver afterward. Also, his PCX scooter had a slick color scheme I’ve never seen back home.</p>

    <h2>5. Steam Tent (Sense Massage & Spa)</h2>
    <p>2025-06-01 <i class="fas fa-sun"></i></p>
    <p>My girlfriend found this place on Xiaohongshu, and it turned out to be pretty popular—you have to book in advance through Facebook. The “steam tent” experience was honestly kind of hilarious. Basically, you crawl into a little fabric tent with a rice cooker at the bottom pumping out steam. After a few minutes, you’re drenched head to toe—just like a steamed bun. I lasted five minutes before tapping out. I was dizzy and overwhelmed. To me, it felt more like torture than a spa treatment. My girlfriend, on the other hand, was totally fine with it. After the steam torture came the Thai massage. I have to admit—Thai massages are the real deal. I almost fell asleep on the table.</p>

    <h2>6. Sticky Waterfall</h2>
    <p>2025-06-02 <i class="fas fa-sun"></i></p>
    <p>This was my first time climbing a waterfall from bottom to top. Some of the rocks had moss on them, which made a few spots super slippery and a bit risky. We started from the base and slowly made our way up, with the water splashing against our legs—refreshing and fun. There were ropes in some sections to help you pull yourself up. Overall, it turned out to be one of the most fun and unique things to do in Chiang Mai.</p>

    <p>This spot is super popular on Xiaohongshu, and sure enough, when we got there, it was packed with Chinese tourists.

    <p>I originally just wandered in to look around, but the campus turned out to be pretty huge. After walking for a while, I got completely lost and had to call a Grab motorbike to take me back to the hotel. The buildings had a bit of an old-school look, but the campus was lush and green—very pleasant overall.</p>

    <h2>11. Heading Home</h2>
    <p>2025-06-04 <i class="fas fa-sun"></i></p>
    <p>On our way back from Chiang Mai, we took a connecting flight through Shanghai, then landed at Nanjing Airport, and finally drove all the way back to Hefei. As the plane was descending into Shanghai at night, I glanced out the window and, through a break in the clouds, caught a glimpse of the Oriental Pearl Tower and the Bund. Even though I’ve been to Shanghai plenty of times, it was actually my first time seeing it from above like that.</p>

    <h2>12. Notes</h2>
    <p>Before the trip, I saw online that you’re supposed to print out your itinerary, carry 20,000 baht in cash, and fill out an arrival card because customs might check everything. But in reality, no one checked a thing. At least for the two of us—and everyone else on our flight—it was smooth sailing. They glanced at our passports, and we were through immigration in under three minutes. No drama at all.</p>
