            <p>2024-09-23---2024-09-24</p>
            <p>Staying in the dorm every day felt boring. The weather wasn‚Äôt too cold, and I‚Äôm probably going to Beijing in October, so I didn‚Äôt have much time left in the Northeast. While I was still here, I decided to explore a bit.</p>

                    <p>I drove from the school to Changchun and first visited the Puppet Manchukuo Imperial Palace. I didn‚Äôt really get it, and I wasn‚Äôt too interested, so I just walked around and left.</p>

            <p>I went to Nanhu Park in the evening. There were quite a few locals, but some paths didn‚Äôt have streetlights at night, which was a bit scary.</p>

            <p>09-24 <i class="fas fa-sun"></i></p>
            <p>I walked around the lake, about 18 km. My feet got blisters by the time I got back to Harbin. Jingyue Pool is beautiful, but it felt a lot like Dongqian Lake in Ningbo.</p>
