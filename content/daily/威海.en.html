            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>2019-06-20 --- 2021-07-10</p>
            <p>         I came to Weihai for my graduate studies and stayed for two years. This place is very suitable for settling down. It has mountains, seas, blue skies, delicious food, an airport, and a port. The population is small, and the people are nice. The only downside is the strong wind.</p>
