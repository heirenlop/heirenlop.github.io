            <p>2022-01-02 --- 2022-01-04</p>
            <p>         Took a weekend trip with my girlfriend for a self-driving tour around Shanghai, visiting Lanxi City, a county-level city under Jinhua. The main reason for coming here was to try the chicken rice cake, and it was so delicious. Little did I know, this would be our last trip before Shanghai went into lockdown.</p>

            <p>01-02 <i class="fas fa-sun"></i></p>
            <p>         I read online that it's best to stay inside Bagua Village, as it's close to everything and has a lot of character. I noticed that most people there share the last name Zhuge.</p>
