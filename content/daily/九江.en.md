We visited the newly developed Bali Lake district—an attractive city with plenty of parks and lakes, plus the Yangtze River running through it.Interestingly, all the cities on this trip—Jiujiang, Nanchang, and Jingdezhen—have rivers. Jiujiang has the Yangtze, Nanchang the Gan River, and Jingdezhen the Chang River. Cities with rivers are always charming."
