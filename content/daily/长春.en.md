                    <p>I drove from the school to Changchun and first visited the Puppet Manchukuo Imperial Palace. I didn’t really get it, and I wasn’t too interested, so I just walked around and left.</p>

            <p>I went to Nanhu Park in the evening. There were quite a few locals, but some paths didn’t have streetlights at night, which was a bit scary.</p>

            <p>09-24 <i class="fas fa-sun"></i></p>
            <p>I walked around the lake, about 18 km. My feet got blisters by the time I got back to Harbin. Jingyue Pool is beautiful, but it felt a lot like Dongqian Lake in Ningbo.</p>
