## 1. From Yu’ebao to Industrial Bank → USD Exchange

The first step was easy: I withdrew ¥30,000 from Yu’ebao into my Industrial Bank account.

Then I used the Industrial Bank app to exchange RMB to USD. I selected “USD” as the currency and chose “Travel” as the reason for exchange.

## 2. Wire Transfer → HSBC One Account

I had already opened an **HSBC One multi-currency account**, so I simply went into the Industrial Bank app and chose "**Overseas Remittance**." I sent the money to myself with the following info:

- Receiving bank: HSBC (Hong Kong)
- SWIFT code: HSBCHKHHHKH
- Account number: My 12-digit HSBC One account
- Purpose: I wrote “Personal travel”
- Address: Just randomly entered a Hong Kong address

The Industrial Bank “Global Card” didn’t charge any fees for this transfer. Pretty awesome.

## 3. HSBC One → Longbridge Deposit

**These days, it seems like mainland users are having a hard time opening accounts with brokers like Futu, Longbridge, and Tiger. You now need proof of overseas employment or a work visa. I got around this by using my Hong Kong driver's license. Should’ve done this earlier—it would’ve saved me a lot of hassle.**

This time, I deposited **¥30,000**, which came out to about **$4,100 USD**.

Here’s my current portfolio:

| Asset  | Amount (CNY) | Type |
|--------|--------------|------|
| QQQM   | ¥16,000      | ETF  |
| SPY    | ¥14,000      | ETF  |

Let’s see how these ETFs perform over time...

So far, I’ve had no issues wiring money from Industrial Bank to HSBC twice. But this **third time**—it got rejected.

A bank rep called me and asked detailed questions:  
“If the USD is for spending, why not send HKD instead?”  
“If you’re traveling to a USD country, do you have a visa or hotel/flight bookings?”  
Industrial Bank’s controls are getting tighter for sure.

This time, I took a different route—wired from Bank of China mainland to Bank of China Hong Kong, then funded the brokerage. Worked perfectly, no deductions.

I deposited **¥50,000**, or around **$7,000 USD**, and kept DCA-ing into QQQM. I also added some VOO this time.

Updated portfolio:

| Asset  | Amount (CNY) | Type |
|--------|--------------|------|
| QQQM   | ~¥50,000     | ETF  |
| SPY    | ~¥14,000     | ETF  |
| VOO    | ~¥16,000     | ETF  |
