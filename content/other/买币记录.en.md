## 1. First Purchase

That day I randomly stumbled upon a YouTube video for beginners on how to buy crypto on Binance using RMB to get USDT, and then swap that for crypto. After watching it, I got curious and decided to try it out myself—just to see how the process worked.

**Purchase record:**
- Total investment: **¥100 RMB**
- Coins bought:**BTC + DOGE**

I had no clue what I was doing—just bought it for fun. I figured it was a good learning experience and didn't mind if I lost 100 yuan.

Fast forward six months: I logged back into my Binance account and saw I had **just over ¥80** left. After checking the charts, looks like the low was around April 2025—at one point my balance was down to **around ¥60**, but it climbed back up to ¥80+.

So far, I made about **¥6** on BTC, but **lost ¥20** on DOGE. 😅

## 2. Second Purchase

This time I went all in on Bitcoin—no more playing around.

**Purchase record:**
- Total investment: **¥900 RMB**
- Coin bought: **BTC**

Let’s see how this one plays out over the next six months. Will I make a profit—or take another hit? I’ll check back later.
